<!-- REPLACE TASKS -->
<h2>Overview</h2>
Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:
- [x] View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- [x] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

<h2>Satisfaction</h2>
<h3>The Good</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The Semantic and accessibilty for HTML is much better than my previous work.</li>
    <li>The Javascript and use of summary and details.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>The Bad</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The imagery is a touch off and could do with improving.</li>
    <li>The CSS doesn't contain any variables for the colours, this was just lazy planning!</li>
  </ul>

<h2>The Process</h2>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>
  <img alt="HTML5" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML5-red?style=flat-square&logo=html5&logoColor=white" />
  <img alt="CSS3" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS3-blue?style=flat-square&logo=css3&logoColor=white" />
  <img alt="JavaScript" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-ffd32b?style=flat-square&logo=JavaScript&logoColor=black" />
  
  <img alt="SASS" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-SASS-bf4080?style=flat-square&logo=sass&logoColor=white" />
</p>
<h3>What I Learnt</h3>
  <p>
    I learnt to only work when focused and upon doing so, I was able to focus more on little details (I usually overlook them).
    The markup for the HTML went really well and hopefully, accessible too.
  </p>
<h3>Continued Development</h3>
  <p>
    I would like to improve the position of the background images and probably move all the colours into variables,
    however; I am mostly happy with this project and will likely not return.
